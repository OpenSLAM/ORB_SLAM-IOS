# ORB_SLAM-IOS
You need to download some dependency and opencv2.framework from
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eS9ha74
Unzip orbslamios.zip and put the dependency folder and opencv2.framework in the orbslamios folder.

The source code is from [ORB-SLAM Monocular](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM) . That's a great work.

You can do some AR projects.
